# Phase 2: Advanced Security Components

This document provides an overview of the advanced security components implemented in Phase 2 of our security infrastructure.

## 1. Account Protection

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- **File**: `server/security/advanced/mfa/MultiFactorAuth.ts`
- **Description**: Provides advanced authentication capabilities beyond passwords, including Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) and recovery codes.
- **Key Features**:
  - TOTP generation and verification
  - Backup/recovery code management
  - QR code generation for easy setup
  - User device verification

### Account Lockout Service
- **File**: `server/security/advanced/account/AccountLockoutService.ts`
- **Description**: Protects against brute force attacks by implementing progressive account lockouts.
- **Key Features**:
  - Progressive timing delays
  - IP-based tracking
  - User-based tracking
  - Configurable lockout thresholds

## 2. Data Protection

### Quantum-Resistant Encryption
- **File**: `server/security/advanced/encryption/QuantumResistantEncryption.ts`
- **Description**: Provides encryption mechanisms that are resistant to quantum computing attacks, implementing post-quantum cryptography algorithms.
- **Key Features**:
  - Multiple post-quantum algorithms (Kyber, NTRU, etc.)
  - Hybrid encryption (classical + post-quantum)
  - Secure key generation and management
  - Configurable security levels
  - Field-level encryption capabilities

### Data Anonymization
- **File**: `server/security/advanced/privacy/DataAnonymization.ts`
- **Description**: Provides privacy-enhancing capabilities for handling personal data.
- **Key Features**:
  - PII identification and masking
  - Differential privacy techniques
  - K-anonymity implementation
  - Multiple anonymization types (redaction, masking, hashing, etc.)
  - Document-level anonymization

## 3. Runtime Security

### Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP)
- **File**: `server/security/advanced/rasp/RuntimeProtection.ts`
- **Description**: Provides real-time application protection by monitoring and blocking attacks during execution.
- **Key Features**:
  - Memory protection with threshold monitoring
  - Dangerous function monitoring
  - Runtime code analysis
  - Command injection prevention
  - Prototype pollution detection
  - Runtime integrity verification

### API Security Service
- **File**: `server/security/advanced/api/APISecurityService.ts`
- **Description**: Provides comprehensive security for API requests including deep inspection, parameter validation, and attack detection.
- **Key Features**:
  - Request deep inspection
  - Parameter validation and sanitization
  - Semantic analysis of API calls
  - Attack pattern detection
  - Anomaly detection
  - Rate limiting

## 4. Privacy & Compliance

### Audit Log Service
- **File**: `server/security/advanced/audit/AuditLogService.ts`
- **Description**: Provides comprehensive, tamper-evident audit logging for all security-sensitive operations and system events.
- **Key Features**:
  - Immutable audit trail with cryptographic verification
  - Categorized audit events
  - User action tracking
  - Detailed contextual information
  - Advanced filtering and search capabilities
  - Compliance reporting and exports

## Integration with Security Fabric

All Phase 2 components integrate with the Security Fabric (from Phase 1) for centralized configuration and management. The Security Fabric provides different security modes that can be configured to enable or disable various security features:

- **BASIC**: Essential security features only
- **STANDARD**: Standard security features
- **ENHANCED**: Enhanced security with quantum resistance and MFA
- **HIGH**: High security with additional ML anomaly detection
- **MAXIMUM**: Maximum security with all features enabled including deep scanning

## Security Event Logging

All components log security events using the standard `logSecurityEvent` function with appropriate categories and severity levels. This enables centralized monitoring and alerting for security events across the application.

## Audit Logging

Security-sensitive operations are logged in the audit trail using the `logAuditEvent` function with appropriate action types and categories. This provides a comprehensive, tamper-evident record of security-related activities.

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Initialize SecurityFabric in MAXIMUM mode
SecurityFabric.initialize(SecurityMode.MAXIMUM);

// Use quantum-resistant encryption for sensitive data
const keyPair = generateKeyPair();
const encrypted = encrypt(sensitiveData, keyPair.publicKey);
const decrypted = decrypt(encrypted, keyPair.privateKey);

// Apply API security middleware to a route
app.use('/api', apiSecurityMiddleware());

// Apply runtime protection
app.use(raspMiddleware());

// Apply data anonymization
const anonymized = anonymizeDocument(userData, {
  'email': { type: AnonymizationType.PSEUDONYMIZATION },
  'phone': { type: AnonymizationType.MASKING }
});

// Log an audit event
logAuditEvent(
  AuditAction.DATA_ACCESSED,
  AuditCategory.DATA_ACCESS,
  'user_profile',
  { userId: user.id }
);
```

## Next Steps

The next phase (Phase 3) will focus on Admin Portal Security Features, including:

1. Security Dashboard for visibility into security events
2. Admin functionality for security configuration
3. Enhanced user management with security features
