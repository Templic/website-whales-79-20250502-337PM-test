# PCI Compliance Implementation

This document outlines the PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) compliance measures implemented in this application to ensure secure payment processing.

## Overview

PCI DSS is a set of security standards designed to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store, or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment. The implementation focuses on the following key requirements:

1. Secure Payment Data Handling
2. API Security Controls
3. Secure Audit Trails and Monitoring
4. Input Validation and Error Handling

## Implemented PCI DSS Requirements

### Requirement 3: Protect Stored Cardholder Data

- **3.4**: Render Primary Account Numbers (PAN) unreadable anywhere it's stored
  - Implementation: Sensitive card data is masked in all logs and displays
  - Location: `server/security/paymentTransactionLogger.ts` - `maskSensitiveValue()` function
  - Location: `server/utils/security.ts` - `redactSensitiveInfo()` function

### Requirement 6: Develop and Maintain Secure Systems and Applications

- **6.5**: Address common coding vulnerabilities
  - Implementation: Input validation with Zod schema in payment routes
  - Implementation: CSRF protection on all payment endpoints
  - Location: `server/payment-routes.ts` - `paymentIntentSchema` validation

- **6.6**: Protect public-facing web applications
  - Implementation: Secure headers and CSRF protection
  - Implementation: Rate limiting on payment endpoints
  - Location: `server/security/middleware/csrfProtection.ts`

### Requirement 10: Track and Monitor All Access to Network Resources and Cardholder Data

- **10.2**: Implement automated audit trails
  - Implementation: Comprehensive transaction logging of all payment operations
  - Location: `server/security/paymentTransactionLogger.ts`

- **10.3**: Record audit trail entries for all components
  - Implementation: Detailed logging of user ID, timestamp, action, status
  - Location: `server/security/secureAuditTrail.ts`

- **10.5**: Secure audit trails so they cannot be altered
  - Implementation: Tamper-evident logs using hash chaining
  - Implementation: Digital signatures for log entries (where keys available)
  - Location: `server/security/paymentTransactionLogger.ts` - `calculateTransactionHash()` function
  - Location: `server/security/secureAuditTrail.ts` - Hash chain implementation

## Key Components

### PaymentTransactionLogger

The `PaymentTransactionLogger` class implements secure, PCI-compliant logging for payment transactions:

- All sensitive data is redacted before logging
- Each log entry is cryptographically secured with a hash
- Log entries form a hash chain for tamper evidence
- Separate methods for successful and failed transactions
- Verification methods to check log integrity

### SecureAuditTrail

A general-purpose secure audit system that complements the payment transaction logger:

- Records all security-relevant events with full context
- Categorizes logs by type (payment, auth, admin)
- Implements tamper evidence via hash chains
- Provides integrity verification capabilities
- Implements secure log rotation

### Security Utilities

Utility functions for security operations:

- IP address detection for accurate user tracking
- Token generation for CSRF protection
- Secure hash creation for data integrity
- Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- Sensitive information redaction

## Transaction Flow Security

1. Payment Intent Creation:
   - Input validation with Zod schema
   - CSRF protection via tokens
   - Safe error handling without leaking details
   - Secure logging of transaction attempts

2. Payment Confirmation:
   - Verification of payment data
   - Secure audit trail entries
   - Redaction of sensitive information
   - Cryptographically secured logs

## Best Practices Implemented

- No sensitive data is logged in plain text
- All payment endpoints protected by CSRF tokens
- All payment errors safely handled without exposing internal details
- Separate log files for different security domains
- Tamper-evident audit trails that can be verified
- Secure log rotation with appropriate file permissions

## Verification and Testing

To verify the PCI compliance implementation:

1. Check log file integrity:
   ```typescript
   import paymentTransactionLogger from './server/security/paymentTransactionLogger';
   const result = paymentTransactionLogger.verifyTransactionLogIntegrity();
   console.log(result);
   ```

2. Verify audit trail integrity:
   ```typescript
   import secureAuditTrail from './server/security/secureAuditTrail';
   const result = secureAuditTrail.verifyLogIntegrity();
   console.log(result);
   ```

## Further Enhancements

- Add a log management dashboard for compliance officers
- Implement periodic integrity checks as scheduled jobs
- Add alerts for potential tampering attempts
- Implement log archiving and rotation policies
