## Architecture Overview

Phase 3 consists of four primary components that work together to provide comprehensive security monitoring and incident response capabilities:

1. **Event Aggregator**: Collects and processes security events from various parts of the application, providing aggregated metrics and insights while optimizing memory usage.

2. **Incident Manager**: Processes security incidents throughout their lifecycle, including creation, assignment, tracking, resolution, and reporting.

3. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Provides real-time visibility into security metrics, PCI compliance status, and active incidents with detailed reporting capabilities.

4. **Breach Detection**: Monitors critical system components for signs of compromise, including file integrity changes, behavioral anomalies, and potential data leakage.

All components are integrated through a **Unified Security Service** that provides a simplified API for the application to interact with the security framework.

## PCI DSS Requirements Addressed

Phase 3 addresses the following PCI DSS requirements:

| Requirement | Description | Implementation |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| **10.6**    | Review logs and security events for all system components to identify anomalies or suspicious activity | EventAggregator component with selective logging and scheduled processing |
| **10.7**    | Retain audit trail history for at least one year, with a minimum of three months immediately available for analysis | SecureAuditStorage with tamper-evident logs and retention policies |
| **10.8**    | Implement a process for the timely detection and reporting of failures of critical security control systems | BreachDetection system with critical path monitoring |
| **11.4**    | Use intrusion-detection and/or intrusion-prevention techniques to detect and/or prevent intrusions into the network | Behavioral anomaly detection in the BreachDetection component |
| **11.5**    | Deploy a change-detection mechanism to alert personnel to unauthorized modification of critical system files | File integrity monitoring in the BreachDetection component |
| **12.10**   | Implement an incident response plan to be initiated upon detection of a suspected security breach | IncidentManager with predefined response templates and workflow |

## Unified Security Service Integration

All four Phase 3 components are integrated through the Unified Security Service, which combines all three phases of our PCI compliance implementation into a single, cohesive security framework.

The Unified Security Service provides a simplified API for the application to interact with:

- `securePaymentTransaction()`: Integrates Phase 1 and Phase 2 components for payment validation and monitoring
- `processAuthEvent()`: Integrates all three phases for authentication event handling
- `validateApiRequest()`: Primarily uses Phase 2 components for API request validation
- `getSecurityStatus()`: Primarily uses Phase 3 components for security status reporting
- `performSecurityScan()`: Uses Phase 3 components for security scanning

The service also handles proper initialization and shutdown of all security components, ensuring resources are properly managed.

## Usage Examples

### Secure Payment Transaction

```typescript
import { unifiedSecurity } from './security/unifiedSecurityService';

// Process a payment transaction securely
async function processPayment(transaction) {
  try {
    const result = await unifiedSecurity.securePaymentTransaction(transaction);
    
    if (result.valid) {
      // Process the payment
      return { success: true, transaction: result.result.transaction };
    } else {
      // Handle validation failure
      return { success: false, errors: result.result.errors };
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle error
    console.error('Payment processing error:', error);
    return { success: false, errors: ['An error occurred during payment processing'] };
  }
}
```

### Handle Authentication Event

```typescript
import { unifiedSecurity } from './security/unifiedSecurityService';

// Handle authentication event
async function handleAuthEvent(event) {
  try {
    await unifiedSecurity.processAuthEvent({
      type: 'login',
      action: 'authenticate',
      status: event.success ? 'success' : 'failure',
      userId: event.userId,
      ipAddress: event.ipAddress,
      userAgent: event.userAgent
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error processing authentication event:', error);
  }
}
```

### Get Security Status

```typescript
import { unifiedSecurity } from './security/unifiedSecurityService';

// Get current security status
async function getSecurityStatus() {
  const status = unifiedSecurity.getSecurityStatus();
  
  if (status.error) {
    console.error('Error getting security status:', status.error);
    return { status: 'error' };
  }
  
  return {
    riskScore: status.riskScore,
    threatLevel: status.threatLevel,
    activeIncidents: status.activeIncidents,
    complianceScore: status.complianceStatus.overall.score,
    lastUpdated: status.timestamp
  };
}
```

### Perform Security Scan

```typescript
import { unifiedSecurity } from './security/unifiedSecurityService';

// Perform a security scan
async function performSecurityScan() {
  try {
    const result = await unifiedSecurity.performSecurityScan();
    
    if (result.error) {
      console.error('Error performing security scan:', result.error);
      return { status: 'error' };
    }
    
    return {
      fileIntegrity: result.fileIntegrity,
      anomalies: result.anomalies,
      dataLeakage: result.dataLeakage,
      timestamp: result.timestamp
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error performing security scan:', error);
    return { status: 'error' };
  }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

Phase 3 implementation prioritizes application performance through several optimization strategies:

1. **Memory-Efficient Event Processing**: The Event Aggregator uses a rolling window approach to prevent memory exhaustion when processing a high volume of events.

2. **Selective Logging**: Only significant security events are logged in detail to prevent log flooding.

3. **Scheduled Processing**: Event aggregation and metric calculations are performed on a schedule rather than in real-time for every event.

4. **Tiered Scanning**: The Breach Detection system uses a tiered approach, with more resource-intensive scans performed less frequently.

5. **Configurable Thresholds**: All components have configurable thresholds to balance security and performance based on the application's needs.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **High CPU Usage During Scans**
   - Increase scan intervals in BreachDetection configuration
   - Reduce the number of files monitored for integrity checks
   - Implement file exclusion patterns for non-critical files

2. **Memory Growth Over Time**
   - Check EventAggregator retention policies and reduce if necessary
   - Verify that event processing is occurring on schedule
   - Check for event leaks (events being added but not processed)

3. **Missed Security Incidents**
   - Review IncidentManager detection rules and thresholds
   - Ensure all application components are properly logging security events
   - Verify that event aggregation is processing events correctly

4. **Dashboard Performance Issues**
   - Reduce metric calculation frequency
   - Implement caching for common queries
   - Use paging for large result sets (incidents, events)

### Diagnostic Tools

The monitoring system includes several diagnostic tools:

- `EventAggregator.diagnostics()`: Returns diagnostic information about event processing
- `IncidentManager.getStats()`: Returns statistics about incident processing
- `BreachDetection.getLastScanStats()`: Returns statistics about the last security scan
- `unifiedSecurity.performDiagnostics()`: Performs diagnostic checks on all security components

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for the Phase 3 implementation:

1. **Machine Learning Integration**: Enhance anomaly detection with machine learning for more accurate threat identification.

2. **Advanced Visualization**: Add more sophisticated visualization tools for security metrics and incidents.

3. **External Integration**: Add integration with external security information and event management (SIEM) systems.

4. **Automated Remediation**: Implement automated remediation for common security incidents.

5. **Threat Intelligence**: Integrate with threat intelligence feeds for proactive threat detection.
