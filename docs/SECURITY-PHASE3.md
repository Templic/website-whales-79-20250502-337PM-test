# Phase 3: Security Monitoring and Incident Response

This document outlines the Phase 3 implementation of PCI DSS compliance requirements focused on security monitoring, breach detection, and incident response.

## Architecture Overview

The Phase 3 system consists of four main components:

1. **Event Aggregator**: Collects and processes security events to identify patterns and trends.
2. **Incident Manager**: Handles security incidents, including detection, tracking, and response.
3. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Provides visibility into security metrics and compliance status.
4. **Breach Detection**: Monitors critical system files and behaviors for signs of compromise.

## PCI DSS Requirements Addressed

Phase 3 satisfies the following PCI DSS requirements:

- **10.6** (Log Review): Regular review of security logs and events.
- **10.7** (Audit Trail Retention): Long-term storage of security events.
- **10.8** (Timely Detection): Proactive detection and alerting of security issues.
- **11.4** (Intrusion Detection): Monitoring for unauthorized access.
- **11.5** (File Integrity Monitoring): Detection of unauthorized file changes.
- **12.10** (Incident Response Plan): Formalized handling of security incidents.

## Component Details

### Event Aggregator (`EventAggregator.ts`)

The Event Aggregator collects security events from various system components and aggregates them into meaningful metrics.

**Key Features:**
- Memory-efficient event collection with size limits to prevent resource exhaustion
- Scheduled aggregation (every 5 minutes) to minimize processing overhead
- 90-day retention of metrics history as required by PCI
- Smart risk scoring algorithm based on security event patterns

**Usage:**
```typescript
// Add an event to be aggregated
eventAggregator.addEvent({
  type: 'authentication',
  subtype: 'login',
  userId: '12345',
  status: 'success',
  data: {
    ipAddress: '192.168.1.1'
  }
});

// Get latest security metrics
const metrics = eventAggregator.getLatestMetrics();

// Force immediate aggregation
eventAggregator.forceAggregation();
```

### Incident Manager (`IncidentManager.ts`)

The Incident Manager handles security incidents throughout their lifecycle, from detection to resolution.

**Key Features:**
- Rule-based incident creation and classification
- Predefined response templates for common incident types
- Detailed incident tracking with actions and evidence
- Secure incident storage with integrity verification

**Usage:**
```typescript
// Create a new security incident
const incident = incidentManager.createIncident(
  'Suspicious authentication activity',
  'Multiple failed login attempts detected from unusual location',
  IncidentSeverity.HIGH,
  EventCategory.AUTHENTICATION,
  IncidentSource.ANOMALY_DETECTION,
  ['authentication', 'brute-force'],
  ['auth-logs-20250503.json']
);

// Add an action to an incident
incidentManager.addIncidentAction(incident, {
  id: 'action-123',
  description: 'IP address blocked',
  type: 'containment',
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  performedBy: 'system',
  outcome: 'successful',
  automaticAction: true
});
```

### Monitoring Dashboard (`MonitoringDashboard.ts`)

The Monitoring Dashboard provides real-time visibility into security metrics and compliance status.

**Key Features:**
- Overall risk assessment and threat level calculation
- Authentication, payment, and API security metrics
- PCI compliance score based on security controls
- Compliance reporting capabilities

**Usage:**
```typescript
// Get current security metrics
const metrics = monitoringDashboard.getCurrentMetrics();

// Generate a compliance report
const report = await monitoringDashboard.generateComplianceReport(
  new Date('2025-04-01'),
  new Date('2025-04-30')
);

// Check PCI compliance status
const complianceStatus = monitoringDashboard.getPciComplianceStatus();
```

### Breach Detection (`BreachDetection.ts`)

The Breach Detection system monitors for signs of system compromise or unauthorized changes.

**Key Features:**
- File integrity monitoring of critical security components
- Behavioral analysis to detect anomalous patterns
- Resource-efficient scanning with scheduled lightweight checks
- Integration with incident management for automatic alerting

**Usage:**
```typescript
// Manually trigger a file integrity scan
const results = await breachDetection.performFileIntegrityScan();

// Check for security anomalies
const anomalies = await breachDetection.checkForAnomalies();

// Check for potential data leakage
const leakage = await breachDetection.checkForDataLeakage();
```

## System Initialization

The Phase 3 components are initialized as part of the main server startup process:

1. Server starts and initializes core components
2. Secure audit trail is initialized
3. Log reviewer is initialized
4. Security scan queue is initialized
5. Phase 3 monitoring system is initialized:
   - Event Aggregator
   - Incident Manager
   - Monitoring Dashboard
   - Breach Detection

## Resource Optimization

Phase 3 was designed with resource efficiency in mind:

- **Selective Event Storage**: Only stores events until the next aggregation cycle
- **Lightweight File Scanning**: Scans only a subset of files during routine checks
- **Scheduled Operations**: Spaces out intensive operations to minimize impact
- **Memory Usage Monitoring**: Delays operations when system memory is constrained

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and troubleshooting steps:

1. **High Memory Usage**: If memory usage is high, the breach detection system will automatically delay scans.
2. **Missing Metrics**: If metrics aren't being generated, check that security events are being properly recorded.
3. **False Positives**: Fine-tune behavioral baselines by updating the values in the constructor.
4. **Log File Size**: Regular cleanup of old metrics is automatic, but manual cleanup can be performed if needed.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for Phase 3:

1. Machine learning-based anomaly detection for more accurate threat identification
2. Integration with external threat intelligence sources
3. Enhanced visualization capabilities for security metrics
4. Automated incident response for common security events
