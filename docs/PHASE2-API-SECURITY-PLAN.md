# Phase 2: API Security & Protection Controls

This document outlines a focused implementation plan for Phase 2 of our PCI DSS compliance project, specifically targeting payment API security as the highest priority to meet core PCI requirements.

## Objective

Implement comprehensive API security controls for our payment processing system to meet PCI DSS requirements 6.5 (secure coding practices), 6.6 (web application protection), and establish a foundation for 11.3 (penetration testing readiness).

## Critical Security Components

### 1. Enhanced API Validation Framework

*PCI DSS Requirements: 6.5.1 (Injection Flaws), 6.5.3 (Insecure Inputs), 6.5.5 (Improper Error Handling)*

A validation system specifically designed for payment transaction security that prevents injection attacks and ensures data integrity.

#### Implementation Priorities

1. **Payment-Specific Validation Rules**
   - ✓ Zod schemas for all payment endpoints with strict type checking
   - ✓ Card number format validation with Luhn algorithm checking
   - ✓ Currency code and amount validation with precision limits

2. **Context-Aware Validation**
   - ✓ Transaction context validation (detecting anomalous payment patterns)
   - ✓ Session state validation for payment operations
   - ✓ Parameter correlation validation (e.g., matching order data with payment amount)

3. **Standardized Error Responses**
   - ✓ PCI-compliant error messages (no revealing internal details)
   - ✓ Consistent error formats with appropriate HTTP status codes
   - ✓ Error logging with secure audit trail integration

```typescript
// server/validation/PaymentValidationService.ts
export class PaymentValidationService {
  // Single entry point for all payment validation
  validatePaymentRequest(endpoint: string, data: any): ValidationResult {
    // Route to specific validation schema based on endpoint
    const validator = this.getValidator(endpoint);
    return validator.validate(data);
  }
  
  // Specific validators for different payment operations
  private getValidator(endpoint: string): PaymentValidator {
    switch (endpoint) {
      case '/payment/create-intent': return new PaymentIntentValidator();
      case '/payment/confirm': return new PaymentConfirmationValidator();
      // Additional payment endpoint validators
      default: return new GenericPaymentValidator();
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Payment-Specific Rate Limiting

*PCI DSS Requirements: 6.5.10 (Resource Exhaustion), 6.6 (Web Application Protection)*

Specialized rate limiting designed for payment endpoints to prevent brute force attacks and API abuse.

#### Implementation Priorities

1. **Tiered Rate Limiting**
   - ✓ Strict limits for payment authentication operations
   - ✓ Transaction amount-based limits (stricter limits for higher amounts)
   - ✓ Progressive limits based on user payment history

2. **Multi-dimensional Limiting**
   - ✓ Composite key generation (IP + user + endpoint) for precise limits
   - ✓ Separate tracking for read vs. write operations
   - ✓ Special handling for repeated failed transactions

3. **Actionable Responses**
   - ✓ Retry-After headers with backoff guidance
   - ✓ Alternative action suggestions in rate limit responses
   - ✓ Administrative alerts for sustained limit violations

```typescript
// server/security/PaymentRateLimiter.ts
export class PaymentRateLimiter {
  // Core rate limiting for payment operations
  checkRateLimit(req: Request): RateLimitResult {
    // Generate appropriate keys based on the payment operation
    const keys = this.generateLimitKeys(req);
    
    // Check multiple rate limit dimensions
    return {
      allowed: this.checkAllLimits(keys, req),
      retryAfter: this.calculateRetryAfter(keys),
      limitType: this.determineLimitType(keys)
    };
  }
  
  // Specialized handling for different payment operation types
  private generateLimitKeys(req: Request): string[] {
    const userId = req.user?.id || 'anonymous';
    const endpoint = req.path;
    const ip = req.ip;
    
    // Create multi-dimensional keys
    return [
      `ip:${ip}`,
      `user:${userId}`,
      `endpoint:${endpoint}`,
      `ip+user:${ip}:${userId}`,
      `user+endpoint:${userId}:${endpoint}`
    ];
  }
}
```

### 3. Transaction Security Monitoring

*PCI DSS Requirements: 10.2 (Automated Audit Trails), 10.6 (Log Review)*

Real-time monitoring system for payment transactions to detect and respond to suspicious activities.

#### Implementation Priorities

1. **Transaction Risk Analysis**
   - ✓ Real-time scoring of payment transactions
   - ✓ Historical pattern comparison for each user
   - ✓ Anomalous payment amount detection

2. **Multi-factor Detection System**
   - ✓ Transaction velocity monitoring (sudden increases in frequency)
   - ✓ Geographic anomaly detection (unusual locations)
   - ✓ Time-pattern analysis (unusual hours or days)

3. **Graduated Response System**
   - ✓ Risk-based challenge requirements
   - ✓ Additional verification for high-risk transactions
   - ✓ Automated blocking of highly suspicious transactions

```typescript
// server/security/TransactionSecurityMonitor.ts
export class TransactionSecurityMonitor {
  // Core risk analysis for payment transactions
  analyzeTransactionRisk(transaction: PaymentTransaction): RiskAssessment {
    // Compile multiple risk factors
    const velocityRisk = this.checkTransactionVelocity(transaction);
    const amountRisk = this.assessAmountRisk(transaction);
    const patternRisk = this.analyzeTransactionPatterns(transaction);
    const locationRisk = this.evaluateLocationRisk(transaction);
    
    // Calculate composite risk score
    const riskScore = this.calculateCompositeRisk([
      velocityRisk,
      amountRisk,
      patternRisk,
      locationRisk
    ]);
    
    return {
      score: riskScore,
      factors: this.identifyRiskFactors(riskScore),
      recommendation: this.determineAction(riskScore)
    };
  }
}
```

### 4. API Access Control Enhancement

*PCI DSS Requirements: 7.1 (Access Restrictions), 8.1-8.3 (Authentication)*

Strengthen existing authentication mechanisms with payment-specific protections and enhanced access controls.

#### Implementation Priorities

1. **Payment-Specific Permissions**
   - ✓ Granular transaction amount-based authorization
   - ✓ Time-bound payment authorizations that expire
   - ✓ Currency-specific payment permissions

2. **Enhanced Authentication Flow**
   - ✓ Step-up authentication for sensitive payment operations
   - ✓ Payment-specific session validation
   - ✓ Transaction origin verification

3. **Comprehensive Access Audit**
   - ✓ Detailed logging of all payment authorization decisions
   - ✓ Failed access attempt monitoring with escalation
   - ✓ Authorized action tracking for all payment operations

```typescript
// server/security/PaymentAccessControl.ts
export class PaymentAccessControl {
  // Verify authorization for specific payment operations
  async authorizePaymentOperation(
    userId: string, 
    operation: PaymentOperationType,
    context: PaymentContext
  ): Promise<AuthorizationResult> {
    // Verify user has basic permission
    const hasPermission = await this.checkBasePermission(userId, operation);
    if (!hasPermission) {
      return { authorized: false, reason: 'PERMISSION_DENIED' };
    }
    
    // Check amount-based authorization if applicable
    if (context.amount) {
      const amountAuthorized = await this.checkAmountAuthorization(
        userId, 
        operation, 
        context.amount,
        context.currency
      );
      
      if (!amountAuthorized) {
        return { authorized: false, reason: 'AMOUNT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED' };
      }
    }
    
    // Log the authorization decision
    await this.logAccessDecision(userId, operation, context, true);
    
    return { authorized: true };
  }
}
```
