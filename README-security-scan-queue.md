# Security Scan Queue System

## Overview

The Security Scan Queue System is a specialized task management system designed to run security scans sequentially in order to:

1. Prevent resource contention issues
2. Ensure proper scan prioritization
3. Maintain scan execution history
4. Support advanced scan scheduling

## Components

### 1. Main Security Components

- **Security Scan Queue**: Manages the sequential execution of security scans
- **Secure Audit Trail**: Provides tamper-evident logging to meet PCI-DSS Requirement 10.5
- **Log Review System**: Automatically reviews security logs to meet PCI-DSS Requirement 10.6
- **Dependency Updater**: Manages dependencies and identifies security vulnerabilities

### 2. Supporting Components

- **System Monitor**: Tracks system resource utilization during scans
- **Background Services**: Manages long-running tasks including security scans
- **Security Scan Manager**: API endpoints for triggering and monitoring scans

## PCI-DSS Compliance

The system addresses two critical PCI-DSS requirements:

### Requirement 10.5: Secure Audit Trails

The `secureAuditTrail.ts` component implements a secure, tamper-evident audit trail system with:

- Cryptographic protection (SHA-256 hashing)
- Chain-of-custody tracking for log events
- Integrity verification mechanisms
- Secure log storage and rotation
- Audit access controls

### Requirement 10.6: Log Review

The `logReviewer.ts` component implements automated log review with:

- Regular automated reviews (every 12 hours)
- Anomaly detection in security logs
- Correlation of security events across systems
- Alert generation for suspicious patterns
- Detailed review reports

## Scan Types

The system supports multiple scan types:

1. **CORE**: Basic security scan of all components
2. **DEPENDENCY**: Scan for outdated or vulnerable dependencies
3. **AUTH**: Authentication security checks
4. **API**: API security scanning
5. **COMPLIANCE**: PCI-DSS and other compliance checks
6. **MALWARE**: Scanning for malicious code patterns
7. **INPUT_VALIDATION**: Checking for input validation issues
8. **ML_SECURITY**: Machine learning-based security analysis

## Scan Scheduling

Scans can be scheduled with different frequencies:

- **ONCE**: Run a single time
- **HOURLY**: Run every hour
- **DAILY**: Run once per day
- **WEEKLY**: Run once per week
- **MONTHLY**: Run once per month

## Usage

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/security/scan/queue`: Get the current scan queue status
- `POST /api/security/scan`: Schedule a new security scan
- `GET /api/security/scan/:id`: Get status of a specific scan
- `DELETE /api/security/scan/:id`: Cancel a specific scan
- `GET /api/security/scheduled`: List all scheduled scans

### Direct Function Calls

```typescript
// Initialize the system
initializeSecurityScanQueue();

// Queue a scan with high priority
enqueueSecurityScan(ScanType.CORE, true, { priority: 10 });

// Schedule a daily dependency scan
createScheduledScan(
  ScanType.DEPENDENCY,
  ScanFrequency.DAILY,
  {
    deep: false,
    description: 'Daily dependency check'
  }
);
```

## Implementation Details

- The security scan queue ensures scans run sequentially, preventing resource contention
- System resource monitoring prevents scans from overloading the server
- The secure audit trail implements cryptographic chaining to prevent tampering
- Log reviewer performs pattern analysis to detect potential security incidents
- Background scan scheduler handles timing of regular security checks

## Verification

The implementation has been verified to successfully address the PCI-DSS compliance warnings by:

1. Implementing secure audit trails with tamper-evident logging
2. Implementing automated log review with anomaly detection
3. Documenting all security findings with detailed reports
4. Integrating with the existing security infrastructure

## Next Steps

Potential enhancements to consider:

1. Implement a more advanced ML-based security analysis
2. Add support for custom scan types and frequencies
3. Enhance the reporting interface with visualizations
4. Implement more sophisticated pattern detection in log analysis
