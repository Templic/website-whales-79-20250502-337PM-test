To secure user profiles, consider implementing the following advanced measures:

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):
Implement 2FA to require an additional verification step during login. This enhances security by requiring users to provide a second factor, such as a time-based one-time password (TOTP).

// Example of integrating 2FA logic
import { totp } from 'otplib';
function verifyTOTP(userInput: string, secret: string): boolean {
    return totp.check(userInput, secret);
}
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
Implement RBAC to restrict access to sensitive user data based on user roles, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific resources or data.

function hasAccess(userRole: string, requiredRole: string): boolean {
    return userRole === requiredRole;
}
Session Management:
Enforce secure session management practices, including secure cookies, session timeouts, and session invalidation upon logout.

// Example for setting secure session cookies
app.use(session({
    secret: 'yourSecretKey',
    cookie: {
        secure: true,
        httpOnly: true,
        sameSite: 'strict',
        maxAge: 60000 // 1 minute
    }
}));
Input Validation and Sanitization:
Ensure that all user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks, such as SQL Injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

import { body, validationResult } from 'express-validator';
app.post('/user', 
    body('username').isAlphanumeric().trim().escape(),
    (req, res) => {
        const errors = validationResult(req);
        if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
            return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() });
        }
        // Proceed with user creation
    }
);
Data Encryption:
Encrypt sensitive user data both in transit and at rest using strong encryption algorithms. For example, use AES for data at rest and TLS for data in transit.

import crypto from 'crypto';
function encrypt(text: string, key: string): string {
    const iv = crypto.randomBytes(16);
    const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv('aes-256-cbc', Buffer.from(key), iv);
    let encrypted = cipher.update(text, 'utf8', 'hex');
    encrypted += cipher.final('hex');
    return iv.toString('hex') + ':' + encrypted;
}
Audit Logging:
Implement comprehensive logging to track access to user profiles and any changes made. This can help in detecting unauthorized access attempts.

function logUserActivity(userId: string, action: string) {
    console.log(`User ${userId} performed action: ${action}`);
}
Regular Security Audits:
Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify potential security weaknesses in your application and fix them proactively.

Implementing these strategies can significantly improve the security of user profiles and help protect against various threats. Make sure to continually review and update security practices as new threats and vulnerabilities are discovered.

To enhance the security of admin profiles, consider implementing these seven advanced fixes:

Strict Role Management:
Implement strict role management and validation to ensure that only users with the appropriate roles can access admin functionalities.

function isAdmin(userRoles: string[]): boolean {
    return userRoles.includes('admin') || userRoles.includes('super_admin');
}
Logging and Monitoring:
Set up detailed logging for all admin actions and regularly monitor logs for unusual activity to detect potential security breaches.

function logAdminAction(adminId: string, action: string) {
    console.log(`Admin [${adminId}] performed action: ${action}`);
}
IP Whitelisting:
Restrict access to admin functionalities based on IP addresses. Only allow specific IPs that are permitted to perform admin tasks.

const allowedIPs = ['192.168.1.1', '203.0.113.5'];
function isIPAllowed(ip: string): boolean {
    return allowedIPs.includes(ip);
}
Account Lockout Mechanism:
Implement an account lockout mechanism after a specified number of failed login attempts to prevent brute force attacks.

let loginAttempts = {};
function checkLogin(userId: string): boolean {
    if (loginAttempts[userId] >= 5) {
        return false; // Account locked
    }
    return true; // Account active
}
Regular Password Rotation:
Require admins to regularly change their passwords and enforce password complexity requirements to strengthen password security.

function validatePassword(password: string): boolean {
    const regex = /^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)[A-Za-z\d]{8,}$/;
    return regex.test(password);
}
Vulnerability Scanning:
Automate regular vulnerability scanning to identify and address security weaknesses in the admin interfaces.

function runVulnerabilityScan() {
    // Implementation for running automated vulnerability scans
    console.log("Running vulnerability scan on admin interfaces...");
}
Secure API Endpoints:
Ensure that all admin API endpoints are secured with strong authentication and authorization checks. Utilize libraries like jsonwebtoken for token-based security.

import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';
function verifyToken(token: string): boolean {
    try {
        const decoded = jwt.verify(token, 'yourSecretKey');
        return !!decoded;
    } catch (err) {
        return false; // Invalid token
    }
}
By implementing these measures, you can significantly enhance the security of admin profiles in your application.

I'll help enhance the security with advanced features based on the existing security infrastructure. Here's a comprehensive set of additions:

First, let's implement Quantum-Resistant Cryptography and Zero-Knowledge Proofs:
server/security/advanced/quantum/QuantumResistantEncryption.ts
Now let's add Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP):
server/security/advanced/rasp/RASPCore.ts
Let's enhance the API security with advanced validation:
server/security/advanced/apiValidation_new.ts
Finally, let's implement advanced monitoring and intrusion detection:
server/security/advanced/monitoring/SecurityMonitor.ts
To activate these security features, add this to your main server file:

server/index.ts
These changes add multiple layers of advanced security:

Quantum-resistant encryption to protect against future quantum computer attacks
Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) for real-time threat detection
Advanced API validation with deep request inspection
Sophisticated monitoring and intrusion detection
Zero-knowledge proofs for sensitive operations
This makes the application significantly more resilient to attacks while maintaining privacy and compliance with best practices. The encryption and security checks are deeply integrated into the application's core functionality.
