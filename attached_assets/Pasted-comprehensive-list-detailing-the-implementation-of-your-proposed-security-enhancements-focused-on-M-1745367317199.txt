Here are three important questions you should consider asking to further enhance your security strategy:

How often should security assessments be conducted?

It's essential to establish a regular schedule for security assessments, such as quarterly or semi-annually, to ensure vulnerabilities are identified and remediated promptly.
What plans are in place for incident response?

Have a clear incident response plan that outlines steps for various potential security incidents, detailing roles, responsibilities, and communication protocols to ensure swift action during a breach.
How do we ensure that security practices keep up with evolving threats?

Consider implementing a continuous learning program for your team and maintaining an updated threat intelligence feed to stay informed about the latest vulnerabilities and attack vectors relevant to your industry.
Addressing these questions can help strengthen your application's security posture.
