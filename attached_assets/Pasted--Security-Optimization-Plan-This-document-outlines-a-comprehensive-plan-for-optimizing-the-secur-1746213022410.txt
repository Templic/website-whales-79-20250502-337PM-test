     res.setHeader(
       'Content-Security-Policy',
       "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'"
     );
     
     // HTTP Strict Transport Security
     res.setHeader(
       'Strict-Transport-Security',
       'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload'
     );
     
     // X-Content-Type-Options
     res.setHeader('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff');
     
     // X-Frame-Options
     res.setHeader('X-Frame-Options', 'DENY');
     
     // Referrer-Policy
     res.setHeader('Referrer-Policy', 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin');
     
     // Permissions-Policy
