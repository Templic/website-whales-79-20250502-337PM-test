  encountering routing issues with your Express application, particularly in the
ChatMessage.tsx component. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and potentially
fix the problem:



Check the Route Configuration: Make sure your route for the ChatMessage
component is set correctly in your Express router. Verify there's no conflicting
routes defined.



Ensure Listening on Correct Port: Since the default ports like 80 and 443 are
reserved and for your development, you should make sure your Express server is
listening on port 5000.

Verify Network Configuration: If you're using Replit, inspect your networking
settings. Ensure external port forwarding is set correctly for your application.
You want to ensure that the routing on the external side matches the internal
configuration.



Debug Logging: Utilize logging within your Express routes to understand where
the request might be failing or being misrouted.



Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS): If you're making API calls from the
frontend that involve different origins, ensure you've set up CORS correctly.

CSRF Token Verification: There are frequent security checks passing for CSRF
token verification from IP 68.230.197.31 as seen in the logs.



Express Router Activity: Heavy routing activity for components, particularly
ChatMessage.tsx with multiple GET requests.



Security Incidents: Multiple file integrity change incidents detected
(INC-20250504-SYS-*) indicating file modifications are being closely monitored.



Rate Limiting: The system uses a sophisticated rate limiting system
(RateLimitingSystem.ts) with:

Context-aware rate limiting

Token bucket algorithm implementation

Different limits for auth, API, admin routes

Security Architecture:



Layered security approach with multiple validation stages

Advanced CSRF protection with deep security features

Comprehensive logging and monitoring

Intelligent threat detection

Server Configuration:



Running in development mode on port 5000

Using Express with Vite for frontend

Has multiple security middleware layers

Notable Concerns:



Multiple security incidents indicating file changes

High frequency of CSRF verifications which could impact performance

Repeated Vite connection/disconnection cycles which may indicate connection
stability issues
