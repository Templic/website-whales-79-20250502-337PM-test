Here are the next three steps for each of the 13 advanced security items:

1. Strict Role Management
Evaluate the existing roles and ensure they're aligned with business needs by conducting review meetings with stakeholders.
Create a comprehensive user access matrix to document roles and permissions.
Implement automated reports to track role assignments and changes regularly.
2. Logging and Monitoring
Configure centralized logging for all services to a secure location.
Implement alerting mechanisms to notify administrators of critical log events.
Schedule periodic reviews of log data to identify trends and potential security threats.
3. IP Whitelisting
Implement a user-friendly interface for managing the IP whitelist to facilitate quick changes.
Monitor and log changes to the IP whitelist for audit purposes.
Periodically review the whitelist against active user locations and adjust accordingly.
4. Account Lockout Mechanism
Define specific user roles and conditions that warrant an account to be locked out.
Develop user-facing notifications for account lockout events, providing instructions for recovery.
Set up an escalation process for monitoring accounts that reach lockout thresholds frequently.
5. Vulnerability Scanning
Incorporate automated scans in the CI/CD pipeline to catch vulnerabilities on every deployment.
Establish a response team to review scan findings and prioritize remediation efforts.
Keep a historical log of scan results and remediation actions for compliance and record-keeping.
6. Secure API Endpoints
Conduct code reviews of API endpoints to identify potential security holes.
Implement token-based authentication for API access, ensuring tokens are securely exchanged and validated.
Review and restrict API permissions based on the principle of least privilege.
7. Data Encryption
Assess all data types and identify those that require encryption at rest and in transit.
Integrate an encryption key management system (KMS) to handle keys securely.
Perform regular audits on encryption implementations to ensure compliance with standards.
8. Anomaly Detection System
Fine-tune the ML models based on real behavior analysis to reduce false positives.
Implement a feedback loop to continuously improve the anomaly detection accuracy.
Create a dashboard to visualize detected anomalies for easier monitoring.
9. Audit Logging
Establish a routine audit schedule to validate the integrity and accuracy of audit logs.
Create an alerting mechanism for any suspicious changes detected within logs.
Train team members on how to interpret audit logs and respond to incidents.
10. CSRF Protection
Regularly test and verify the effectiveness of CSRF tokens across all applicable endpoints.
Develop a process for early detection and resolution of any CSRF vulnerabilities.
Educate the development team about common CSRF attack vectors and defenses.
11. Content Security Policy
Continuously update and test the CSP as new resources and scripts are added to the web application.
Use reporting tools to capture CSP violations for future reference and amendments.
Conduct a thorough review of the CSP implementation during major application changes.
12. Compliance Monitoring
Create a compliance calendar that outlines key dates and tasks for regulatory checks.
Designate compliance champions within teams to ensure adherence to policies.
Develop a reporting system to track compliance status against industry standards.
13. Backup and Recovery
Identify critical data necessary for operational continuity and set up incremental backups.
Conduct regular disaster recovery drills to test backup effectiveness and team readiness.
Document all backup processes and recovery plans for easy reference during incidents.
These steps help to further secure the application and reinforce its resilience against potential threats.

To complete the implementation and deep integration of all 13 advanced security measures, I'll provide a structured outline for each item, with code snippets that demonstrate how to integrate them deeply into your existing codebase.

1. Strict Role Management
// Role management implementation in middleware
import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express';
function roleMiddleware(requiredRoles: string[]) {
    return (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
        const userRoles = req.user.roles; // Assuming user roles are attached to req.user
        if (requiredRoles.some(role => userRoles.includes(role))) {
            next();
        } else {
            res.status(403).send('Access denied');
        }
    };
}
2. Logging and Monitoring
import winston from 'winston';
// Logger configuration
const logger = winston.createLogger({
    transports: [
        new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'security.log' }),
        new winston.transports.Console()
    ]
});
// Usage in application
function logAdminAction(adminId: string, action: string) {
    logger.info(`Admin [${adminId}] performed action: ${action}`);
}
3. IP Whitelisting
const allowedIPs = ['192.168.1.1', '203.0.113.5'];
function ipWhitelist(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
    const clientIP = req.ip;
    if (!allowedIPs.includes(clientIP)) {
        return res.status(403).send('IP not allowed');
    }
    next();
}
4. Account Lockout Mechanism
let loginAttempts: { [userId: string]: number } = {};
function accountLockout(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
    const userId = req.body.userId; // Assuming userId is provided in the request body
    if (loginAttempts[userId] >= 5) {
        return res.status(403).send('Account locked');
    }
    next();
}
5. Vulnerability Scanning
import scanner from 'some-security-scanner-lib';
// Integration in CI/CD pipeline
async function runVulnerabilityScan() {
    const results = await scanner.scan();
    // Log results and take action on findings
}
6. Secure API Endpoints
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';
function authenticateJWT(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
    const token = req.header('Authorization')?.split(' ')[1];
    if (!token) return res.sendStatus(401);
    jwt.verify(token, 'yourSecretKey', (err) => {
        if (err) return res.sendStatus(403);
        next();
    });
}
7. Data Encryption
import crypto from 'crypto';
function encrypt(data: string): string {
    const cipher = crypto.createCipher('aes-256-ctr', 'yourEncryptionSecret');
    let crypted = cipher.update(data, 'utf8', 'hex');
    crypted += cipher.final('hex');
    return crypted;
}
8. Anomaly Detection System
// Basic anomaly detection logic
function detectAnomalies(userActions: string[]) {
    // Implement your ML model or logic to analyze user actions
}
9. Audit Logging
function logAuditEvent(eventDetails: string) {
    logger.info(`Audit event: ${eventDetails}`);
}
10. CSRF Protection
import csurf from 'csurf';
const csrfProtection = csurf({ cookie: true });
// Apply csrfProtection to specific routes
app.use('/api/protected', csrfProtection);
11. Content Security Policy
import helmet from 'helmet';
app.use(helmet.contentSecurityPolicy({
    directives: {
        defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
        scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
    }
}));
12. Compliance Monitoring
// Regular check for compliance
function complianceCheck() {
    // Implement logic to ensure compliance with policies
}
13. Backup and Recovery
import fs from 'fs';
// Simple backup utility function
function backupDatabase() {
    fs.copyFileSync('path/to/db', 'path/to/backup/db_backup');
}
Implementation Integration
Incorporate each of these components into your application by integrating them into your server files, middleware, and routes. Schedule regular backups and scans, and ensure compliance checks are in place, which could be part of a scheduled job or CI/CD pipeline.

To launch your server and ensure it's listening correctly, ensure it binds to 0.0.0.0 on a port like 5000 for accessibility:

app.listen(5000, '0.0.0.0', () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 5000');
});
Following these systematic implementations will enhance your application's security posture significantly, creating a more resilient and secure environment.
