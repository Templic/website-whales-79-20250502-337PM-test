Implementation Details
For each of these components, I'll follow these implementation guidelines:

Modular Design: Each security component will be implemented as a standalone module with clear interfaces
Progressive Enhancement: Components will be implemented with graceful degradation
Performance Optimization: Security features will be designed to minimize performance impact
Configurability: All components will be easily configurable via the security fabric
Logging & Monitoring: Comprehensive logging will be integrated into all components
Testing: Each component will include thorough testing
Documentation: Clear documentation will be provided for all security features
