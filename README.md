## Component Organization

### Active Components
Components are organized into feature-specific directories that align with their primary functions in the application. Each feature directory contains components specific to that feature, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to navigate.

### Deprecated Components
- **Music Components:** Components under `components/music/` are marked as deprecated and should not be used in new development. Their functionality has been moved to the `features/audio/` directory, which contains the current audio-related components.
- **Future Removal:** These components are retained for backward compatibility but are scheduled for removal in future versions.

### Imported Components
The `components/imported/` directory contains components that were imported from other sources:
- **v0 Components:** From the original application version
- **Lovable Components:** From the lovable.dev platform

## Documentation Standards

All components should follow the documentation standards outlined in the [Component Documentation Guide](docs/COMPONENT_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md):

- **File Header:** Each file should have a header with metadata
- **Component JSDoc:** Each component should have detailed JSDoc comments
- **Props Documentation:** Props should be documented with types and descriptions
- **Deprecation Notices:** Deprecated components should have clear migration guidance

Example of properly documented component:

```tsx
/**
 * @file ComponentName.tsx
 * @description Brief description of the component's purpose
 * @author [Original Author]
 * @created [Creation Date]
 * @updated [Last Update Date]
 * @status [Active | Deprecated | Experimental]
 */

/**
 * ComponentName
 * 
 * Detailed description of what the component does and its purpose.
 * 
 * @example
 * <ComponentName prop1="value" prop2={value2} />
 */
```

## Routing

The application uses the `wouter` library for client-side routing. All routes are defined in `App.tsx`. Some routes are marked as commented out, which indicates they are deprecated but kept for reference.

Key route categories:
- **Main Pages:** Home, About, Contact, etc.
- **Music & Experience:** Music release, archived music, cosmic experiences
- **Shop Routes:** Product browsing, cart, checkout
- **Admin Routes:** Admin portal, analytics, user management
- **Demo Pages:** Component previews and tests

For a complete list of routes, see [Routes Documentation](docs/ROUTES.md).

## Scripts

The `scripts/` directory contains utilities for managing the codebase:

- **Component Analysis:** `analyze-similar-components.js` identifies similar components for consolidation
- **Component Migration:** `component-migration.js` helps with migrating components to new locations
- **Component Consolidation:** `consolidate-components.js` merges similar components
- **Repository Reorganization:** `repository-reorganization.js` maintains the directory structure

## Development Guidelines

1. **New Components:** Place new components in their corresponding feature directories
2. **Deprecating Components:** Instead of deleting components, mark them as deprecated using comments
3. **Routing Changes:** When deprecating routes, comment them out rather than removing them
4. **Documentation:** Keep all README files up to date with the latest changes
5. **Testing:** Test both active and recently modified components
6. **Security:** Follow security best practices outlined in the security documentation
7. **Dependency Management:** Regularly update dependencies using the provided scripts

### TypeScript Error Management Best Practices

1. **Type Foundation First:** Establish strong type definitions before implementing functionality
2. **Error Dashboard:** Regularly review the TypeScript error dashboard at `/admin/typescript-errors`
3. **Error Categorization:** Use the error categorization system to prioritize critical errors
4. **Batch Processing:** Use batch processing for related errors with common root causes
5. **Error Pattern Recognition:** Create patterns for recurring errors to enable automated fixing
6. **Fix Verification:** After applying fixes, verify they don't introduce new errors
7. **OpenAI Integration:** When fixing complex errors, use the AI-assisted analysis tools
8. **Error Prevention:** Use pre-commit hooks to prevent introducing new errors

### Performance Best Practices

1. **Virtualization:** Use VirtualizedList for rendering large datasets
2. **Image Optimization:** Use OptimizedImage for all image content
3. **Lazy Loading:** Implement LazyLoad for components not needed on initial render
4. **Memoization:** Use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback appropriately
5. **Memory Management:** Include useMemoryLeakDetection in complex components
6. **Animation:** Use requestAnimationFrame and the animation batching utilities
7. **Performance Monitoring:** Implement PerformanceProfiler for critical components
8. **Code Splitting:** Use dynamic imports for routes and large components

## Agentic Development

The project leverages Replit's Agentic vibe-coding approach for enhanced development:

1. **Collaborative AI Assistance:** Work with the Replit Agent to accelerate development
2. **Vibe-Driven Component Creation:** Create components by describing their vibe and functionality
3. **Documentation Generation:** Automatically generate comprehensive documentation
4. **Performance Optimization:** Leverage AI insights for optimizing critical code
5. **Creative Exploration:** Focus on creative aspects while the Agent handles implementation details

See the [Agentic Vibe-Coding](docs/replit-integration/AGENTIC_VIBE_CODING.md) documentation for details.

## Backend Integration

The application uses an Express backend that connects to a PostgreSQL database. Key backend files:

- **server/routes.ts:** API route definitions
- **server/storage.ts:** Data storage interface
- **shared/schema.ts:** Shared data model definitions
- **server/tsErrorStorage.ts:** TypeScript error management storage
- **server/utils/ts-error-analyzer.ts:** TypeScript error analysis utilities
- **server/utils/ts-error-fixer.ts:** TypeScript error fixing utilities
- **server/utils/openai-integration.ts:** AI-powered error analysis integration
